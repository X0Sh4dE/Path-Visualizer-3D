# Path Visualizer

*An interactive Unity3D game that visualizes traditional AI search algorithms on dynamically generated mazes. Designed for students, developers, and AI enthusiasts to explore BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, A* **, and Greedy Best First Search with real-time, step-by-step animations.*

# Features 

* Multiple AI Search Algorithms: BFS, DFS, A*, Dijkstra, Greedy Best First
* Multiple Camera Views for maze and path exploration visualization
* Dynamic Maze Generation with adjustable path variation and complexity
* Real-time Visualizations of node exploration, path cost, and length
* Educational Tool for understanding AI and pathfinding concepts interactively
